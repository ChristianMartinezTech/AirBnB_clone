#  First project 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console üëæ

 | ![Alt text](https://static.dw.com/image/56218728_303.jpg "Title") |
 | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |


In this project we are going to clone a web application step by step of AirBnB, we will use tools built by ourselves throughout the project such as HTML / CSS templates, database storage, API, front-end integration which will also serve us for later projects.

## Content ‚úçÔ∏è
Each part of the project is intertwined and will help us to:
* Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization:   Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place‚Ä¶) that inherit from BaseModel
* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## Instructions ü¶æ
The first thing we must do is create our own shell limited to a specific use case, in this case we want to be able to manage the objects of our project and we will do it as follows:
1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc‚Ä¶
3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc‚Ä¶)
4. Update attributes of an object
5. Destroy an object

## Installation üöÄ

1. Have vagrant, wsl, visual studio code or a virtual machine.
